# TReND-CaMinA
## A Low-Cost Open-Source Teaching Initiative to Promote Computational Neuroscience in Africa

##### Abstract

In 2022 we set up the _CaMinA_, a residential summer school with the goal of educating young African researchers in computational neuroscience and machine learning.

It's low-budget, free to attend, and open-source. 

Since then we've hosted a bunch of courses across Africa (Ghana 2023, Rwanda 2024, Zambia 2025, Kenya 2026,...) and had a lot of fun!
