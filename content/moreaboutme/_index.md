## Wow, you wanted to know more about me...

### Mostly academic stuff
* In 2025, I'll be starting as an **AI resident at [X](https://x.company), the moonshot factory** working on ~top secret Google  stuff~
* I did my **PhD at the [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/), UCL**. 
* During this time I met an amazing group of neuroscientists and we **set up the [TReND CaMinA summer school](https://trendinafrica.org/trend-camina/)**\*
* I previously **interned at [OIST](https://www.oist.jp), Japan**\* (an cool science institute on a tiny tropical island) with [Prof. Tomoki Fukai](https://groups.oist.jp/ncbc). 
* During this time I was a **participant on the [OCNC](https://groups.oist.jp/ocnc/tutors-participants-ocnc2022) summer school**\*\*
* Before my PhD I was a **[Herchel Smith scholar](https://www.emma.cam.ac.uk/about/jobs/harvard/dates/) at Harvard**. This allowed me to pivot from physics to neuroscience. I worked with Prof. Cengiz Pehlevan and Prof. Sam Gershman on various [bits and bobs](../papers/whatmakesneuronspicky/). 
* I did my **MSc thesis on [unsupervised ML for cancer transcriptomics](../papers/oVAErian/)** with Prof. Pietro Lio [(Cambridge)](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/) and Dr. Syed Haider [(ICR)](https://www.icr.ac.uk)
* I did my **BA & MSci (Physics, Natural Sciences) at Cambridge**. I was also born in Cambridge. Back then I used to row a lot.
* I did a **[summer undergraduate reseach fellowship](https://sfp.caltech.edu/undergraduate-research/programs/surf) at Caltech**\*\* with Profs. Andrew Thompson and Georgy Manucharyan looking at [CNNs for turbulence prediction](../papers/turbulence/)
* I'm not just an academic; I was briefly a **consultant for a London-based financial start-up** building ML tools for automating business valuations.

### Non-academic stuff
* I like trail running! My partner and I recently did the **[Scilly60 ultra-marathon](https://scilly60.co.uk)** and have nearly finished **running the Camino de Santiago**\*\* across the north of Spain.
* I used to dabble in **[drone videography](https://www.instagram.com/tomgeorgedroneson)** until [I crashed it into a university in Rwanda](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DBrWe44OShW/?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR2RD4mhIZy0aNCziw3Gd0InMr-r7c4_tkvOP7oV8c2671R1ykuaFnEgFe0_aem_w8tE9NYuIPIX7u3T2UwIyw). 
* I brew and ferment a lot of things. 
* Whilst living in London, my friends and I have been **trying to map [all good pubs worth going to.](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1XN_XfVnvRMo0FnufJdWrQLTRyEZMVPEL&ll=51.50715616579335%2C-0.1378428999999759&z=11)** 

\* an amazing experience which I would recommend to any student. Drop me an [email](mailto:tomgeorge1@btinternet.com) if you want to know more or how to apply.

\*\* top ten experiences of my life...seriously.
